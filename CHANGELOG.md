# Change Log

## [0.1.22] - 2025-08-05

### üéØ Root Cause Fix - Duplicate Script Execution Prevention

- **Fixed Duplicate Script Loading**: Implemented global flag to prevent webview script from executing multiple times, which was the root cause of VS Code API "already been acquired" errors
- **Eliminated Race Conditions**: Script now initializes only once, preventing message passing conflicts and state corruption
- **Resolved Core Architecture Issue**: Addressed the fundamental problem that was causing all previous fixes to fail

## [0.1.21] - 2025-08-05

### üåç Universal Workspace Support & Core Messaging Fixes

- **Universal Workspace Support**: Removed workspace-specific detection logic - extension now works in any workspace and any VS Code variant
- **Robust VS Code API Acquisition**: Implemented comprehensive fallback strategies for `acquireVsCodeApi()` with multiple detection methods and functional fallbacks
- **Fixed Message Structure Issues**: Added detailed logging and validation to ensure `projectState` is properly structured and sent to webview
- **Complete Fallback State**: Updated fallback project state to include all required fields for proper validation
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the message passing system

## [0.1.20] - 2025-08-05

### üö® Critical Bug Fixes - Root Cause Resolution

- **Fixed Workspace Detection Logic**: Added comprehensive logging and improved workspace detection algorithm in `configManager.ts` to properly identify the ai-prd-generator workspace among multiple open workspaces
- **Resolved VS Code API Acquisition Error**: Implemented robust global singleton pattern for `acquireVsCodeApi()` in `main.ts` with fallback handling to prevent "already been acquired" errors
- **Fixed Project State Validation**: Updated `isValidProjectState()` function in `uiUtils.ts` to include all required fields (`hasHandover`, `handoverFiles`, `handoverCount`, `workspaceUri`) that were causing validation failures
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added detailed diagnostic logging throughout the workspace detection and validation processes for better debugging

## [0.1.19] - 2025-08-05

### üêû Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements

- **Fixed Workspace Detection**: Implemented a more robust workspace detection strategy in `configManager.ts` to correctly identify the `ai-prd-generator` workspace, even when other projects are open or no file is active. This resolves issues with incorrect project state on initial load.
- **Fixed VS Code API Error**: Resolved the `An instance of the VS Code API has already been acquired` error in the webview by implementing a singleton pattern for `acquireVsCodeApi()` in `main.ts`. This ensures the API is only acquired once, stabilizing webview functionality like setting the API key.

## [0.1.18] - 2025-08-05

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Redesign - UI Race Condition Fix

**Major Architectural Improvement:**

- **Complete Webview Initialization Redesign**: Implemented comprehensive architectural redesign of webview initialization and message passing system to eliminate recurring UI race conditions
- **New Coordination Protocol**: Added proper handshake between extension and webview to ensure messages are only sent when UI is truly ready
- **Fixed Initial Project State Detection**: Project state is now properly detected and sent on panel load, eliminating blank panel issues
- **Robust Message Sequencing**: API key status is sent immediately, but project state waits for UI confirmation to prevent race conditions

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Added `handleUiReady.ts`**: New handler for UI readiness confirmation from webview
- **Enhanced `handleWebviewReady.ts`**: Proper coordination protocol that waits for UI confirmation
- **Updated UI Initialization**: Webview now sends `uiReady` message after DOM elements are confirmed cached
- **Fixed Missing HTML Elements**: Added required `post-generation-controls` container to webview HTML
- **Message Router Integration**: Registered new coordination protocol handlers

**New Initialization Flow:**
1. Webview loads ‚Üí sends `webviewReady`
2. Extension responds ‚Üí sends `apiKeyStatus` immediately
3. Webview initializes UI ‚Üí sends `uiReady` when DOM ready
4. Extension receives `uiReady` ‚Üí sends `updateState` with project state
5. Webview processes state ‚Üí UI updates safely

**Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates recurring UI race conditions
- ‚úÖ Fixes blank panel on load
- ‚úÖ Proper initial project state detection
- ‚úÖ Stable UI behavior across all scenarios
- ‚úÖ Foundation for future semantic search integration

## [0.1.14] - 2025-08-03

### üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility & Bug Fixes

- **Robust DOM Initialization**: Implemented retry mechanism for DOM element discovery with cross-platform timing compatibility
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Resolved `ReferenceError: prdFiles is not defined` in ProjectStateDetector that was preventing project state detection
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: Updated all path operations to use VS Code URI APIs for Windows, macOS, and Linux compatibility
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error logging with VS Code variant detection for better debugging

**Technical Details:**

- Added `getWorkspaceUri()` with multiple detection strategies (workspace folders, active editor, workspace file)
- Implemented `initializeElementsWithRetry()` for robust DOM element initialization
- Fixed variable scope issue in `ProjectStateDetector.findPRDFiles` method
- Added DOM ready state checking and DOMContentLoaded event handling
- Enhanced error logging with structured context including VS Code variant information

**Compatibility:**

- ‚úÖ VS Code (all versions)
- ‚úÖ VS Code Insiders
- ‚úÖ Cursor
- ‚úÖ Windsurf
- ‚úÖ Other VS Code-based editors
- ‚úÖ Windows, macOS, Linux
- ‚úÖ Any project workspace configuration
