## [0.1.13] - 2025-08-03

### Added
- **Enhanced CCS Backend Infrastructure**: Complete backend implementation for semantic-powered Code Comprehension Score analysis
  - `CodebaseLensIntegrationService`: Integrates with Codebase Lens extension for semantic search capabilities

### Enhanced
- **CCS Scoring Range**: Expanded from 30-70% (basic analysis) to 15-95% (semantic analysis) for more nuanced assessment
- **Semantic Analysis Capabilities**: 
  - Documentation quality assessment beyond file existence
  - Technical debt quantification (TODO/FIXME tracking, known issues, legacy code indicators)
  - Architecture pattern recognition (auth systems, data flow, API design, database modeling)
  - Code quality indicators (testing maturity, security practices, performance considerations)

### Technical
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when Codebase Lens extension unavailable
- **Command Registration**: Added `GENERATE_ENHANCED_CCS` command for enhanced analysis
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in test fixtures for ProjectState interface
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback for semantic analysis

### Notes
- Enhanced CCS backend infrastructure complete (Phase 1)
- UI integration for enhanced CCS pending (Phase 2)
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing basic CCS analysis

## [0.1.12] - 2025-07-30

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue with the "Generate Handover Document" command by ensuring it uses the shared `PanelManager` instance correctly, preventing UI conflicts.
- Added the missing command registration for handover document generation in the message handler.

### Changed
- Refactored the test runner to execute the entire test suite, not just a single file, by creating a centralized test suite entry point.
- Improved and standardized documentation for `codebaseAnalysisService.ts` and `fileSystemUtils.ts` for better clarity and maintainability.

### Added
- Created a new test suite entry point (`src/test/suite/index.ts`) to discover and run all tests dynamically.

All notable changes to the "ai-prd-generator" extension will be documented in this file.
