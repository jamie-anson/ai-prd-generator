### **Context Card Schema Definition**

This document defines the structure and format for a "Context Card." Context Cards are Markdown files designed to provide a stable, human-readable, and verifiable context for an LLM agent performing a coding task.

#### **File Naming Convention**

Context cards should be named after the component or feature they describe, using kebab-case.
*Example:* `feature-authentication.md`, `ui-component-button.md`

---

### **Structure**

Each card is a Markdown file composed of the following sections:

#### `ID`

A unique, machine-readable identifier for the card, used for tracking dependencies. This should match the filename without the extension.

* **Example:** `ID: feature-authentication`

#### `Summary`

A concise, one-to-two sentence summary of the component's purpose, generated by an LLM based on static analysis.

* **Example:** `Summary: Provides services for user registration, login, and session management.`

#### `Public API`

Lists the functions, methods, and classes that are considered the public interface. Implementations are omitted. Each item will be in a language-annotated code block.

* **Example:**

    ```typescript
    // Functions/Methods
    function login(user: string, pass: string): Promise<SessionToken>
    
    // Classes
    class UserProfile {
      username: string;
      email: string;
    }
    ```

#### `Data Structures`

Defines the key data types, interfaces, or schemas passed to or returned from the Public API.

* **Example:**

    ```typescript
    interface SessionToken {
      value: string;
      expiresAt: number;
    }
    ```

#### `Dependencies`

A list of other Context Card `ID`s that this component relies on. This creates a graph of contexts.

* **Example:**

    ```
    Dependencies:
    - data-storage-service
    - notification-service
    ```
