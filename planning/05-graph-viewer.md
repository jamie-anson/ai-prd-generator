# Phase 5: Graph Output & Interactive Viewer (âœ… Complete)

*Vibe: The connections are clear!*

**Goal:** Display the generated graph data using Cytoscape.js.

**Steps:**

1. **Integrate `cytoscape.js` Library:**
    * Installed the `cytoscape` and `@types/cytoscape` npm packages.
    * Copied the minified `cytoscape.min.js` file into the local `src/media` directory.
    * Updated `tsconfig.json` to include the `"dom"` lib to resolve type definition conflicts.

2. **Create `viewGraphPrd` Command:**
    * Registered a new command `ai-prd-generator.viewGraphPrd`.
    * Added a context menu item "View as Interactive Graph" that appears for files ending in `.graph.json`.

3. **Implement Webview Panel:**
    * The command reads the content of the selected graph file.
    * It opens a new webview panel, loads `cytoscape.min.js`, and passes the graph data to the script.
    * The script initializes Cytoscape with a `cose` layout and basic styling for nodes and edges.

## Implementation Details

* **Library:** `cytoscape.js` was chosen for its rich feature set and performance.
* **Command:** A new command `ai-prd-generator.viewGraphPrd` was added.
* **Context Menu:** The command appears in the explorer context menu for any file ending in `.graph.json`.
* **Webview:** A new webview panel is created to host the graph. The `cytoscape.min.js` library is loaded locally from `src/media` to comply with CSP.
* **Rendering:** The webview script listens for a `renderGraph` message containing the graph data, then initializes Cytoscape with a `cose` (force-directed) layout for clear visualization.
* **Interactivity (Refinement):**
  * A properties panel was added to the webview.
  * Clicking on a node now displays all of its associated data in the panel.
  * The panel can be closed by clicking the background or a dedicated close button, providing an intuitive way to inspect graph elements.
