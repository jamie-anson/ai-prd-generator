# Phase 6: Refinement & Polish

## Objective

To improve the overall user experience, security, and robustness of the extension by adding polish and addressing key items from the PRD.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. UX Feedback: Loading Indicators

- **Status:** Complete
- **Description:** Added loading indicators to all webviews to provide clear feedback to the user during asynchronous operations.
  - **Main Generation View:** A "Generating..." message is displayed and the button is disabled while the LLM is processing the request.
  - **JSON Viewer:** A "Loading..." message is shown until the JSON data is parsed and rendered.
  - **Graph Viewer:** A "Loading Graph..." message is shown until the Cytoscape graph is initialized and rendered.

### 2. Security: Secure API Key Storage

- **Status:** Complete
- **Description:** Migrated API key handling from `settings.json` to VS Code's secure `SecretStorage` API.
  - Created a new command `ai-prd-generator.setApiKey` to prompt users for their key and store it securely.
  - Updated the generation logic to retrieve the key from `SecretStorage`.
  - Provided clear error messages guiding the user to set the key if it's missing.

### 3. Error Handling

    *   Wrap API calls and file operations in `try/catch` blocks.
    *   Use `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` for critical failures.
    *   Use `vscode.window.showWarningMessage` for non-critical issues.

3.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    *Use Tailwind CSS to ensure all webviews have a clean, consistent design.
    *   Write clear placeholder text and instructions in the input webview.

4. **Testing:**
    - Test with a variety of inputs (long, short, vague, specific).
    - Simulate API errors and network failures.
    - Verify all files are created correctly and visualizations are accurate.
